### Hi, I'm Fiona (aka Airtower)! :smiley_cat:

I'm an independent IT engineer by trade, in addition to what you can
see in my repositories my main areas of expertise are:

* Security, especially network security, TLS, and
  PKI. :closed_lock_with_key:
* Linux (especially Debian or Alpine), again with focus on networking
  and security, as well as containers. :penguin:
* Software development. My main languages so far are Python :snake:,
  C, and Java, and I'd really like to get more experience with Rust.
* CI & test automation. I've worked on many test suites, including
  ones used in security evaluation.
* I love to dig into tricky bugs and new things! :smile_cat:

Want to work with me? Send me a mail! For encrypted mail you can [find
my key on `keys.openpgp.org`](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/E4D3138FE2D9F2FA8152FD91EEA726CE21235A58).
I offer freelance consulting, development, and training, remote work
strongly preferred. I'm set up for clients in the EU :eu:, beyond I
might need some time to check the legalese.
